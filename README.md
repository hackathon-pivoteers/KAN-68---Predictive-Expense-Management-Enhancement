**Predictive Expense Management Dashboard**

**Code Explanation:**
This code implements a user-friendly dashboard using HTML and JavaScript to visualize predicted expenses. It utilizes the Chart.js library to display expense predictions and trends.

The code starts with the basic HTML structure and includes the Chart.js library. The CSS style ensures the chart canvas is centered and has a maximum width of 600 pixels.

The script section initializes mock data for predicted expenses and months. These should be replaced with real data from the Predictive Expense Management module.

The chart is created using Chart.js with the 'line' type. Labels are set to the months array, and predicted expenses are set as data. Additional styling options are provided.

The 'options' section configures the chart, allowing it to be responsive and setting the y-axis to start from zero.

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize design requirements and gather assets with UX/UI designers.
2. Replace mock data with real data from the Predictive Expense Management module.
3. Enhance frontend based on design requirements.
4. Integrate frontend with the Predictive Expense Management module.
5. Collect user feedback and iterate on the design.
6. Test for usability, responsiveness, and data accuracy.
7. Make necessary improvements and optimizations.
8. Document and comment code for future maintenance.
